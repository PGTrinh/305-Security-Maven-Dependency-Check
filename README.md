## 1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
 My customer was Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for clients in areas including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. To ensure secure communication, they were interested in integrating a file verification mechanism into their web application.

## 2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
 I am excellent at spotting erroneous results from vulnerability scans and putting software security measures in place to ensure secure development procedures. The company's data is safe and secure thanks to the effective implementation of encryption and a thorough dependency check, which allowed for the detection and remediation of all known vulnerabilities.

## 3. What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
 It was difficult for me to accurately identify the report's areas of vulnerability. I believe that every component of a project is crucial, but that wasn't exactly what the assignment required

## 4. How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
 I wanted to strengthen the most exposed levels of the client's project's security by focusing on them. In the future, I intend to evaluate potential vulnerabilities using strategies like vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Additionally, I want to use online CVE databases more often to look up and use mitigation strategies. To ensure successful mitigation of vulnerabilities, remaining current with security best practices and industry standards will also be a priority.

## 5. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I carried out many tests such as dependencies test, code compile, manual review, to ensure that dependencies were not subject to exploitation in order to guarantee the functioning and security of the code and application. I repeated the testing procedure after modifying the code to ensure maintained operability and safety.

## 6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Running vulnerability check is necessary to find any new vulnerabilities that may have been added. I did a lot of study throughout the course to figure out the best way to implement SHA-256 hashing in Java. Additionally, I received useful experience configuring the pom.xml file to run a dependency check, which I believe will be an important skill for me to have in the future because dependency checks will continue to be crucial in program development.

## 7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
 I believe the most thorough assignment was creating the Spring API where we had to create a checksum. It covered a wide range of topics related to Spring, security, dependency-check, analyze for vulnerabilities, and standard code methods.
